      Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical 
physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre 
for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian 
Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
</br>
</br> 
Hawking was born in Oxford, into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university 
education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he 
began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics 
and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. 
 </br>
In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset 
slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – ALS, for short) that gradually, over the 
decades, paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially 
through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.
 </br>
Prof Hawking completed his PhD and went on to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics - a role once held by Sir Isaac Newton - described him as "an inspiration to millions".
</br>
Queues have formed at Gonville and Caius College - where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years - to sign a book of condolence.

Buckingham Palace said the Queen will be sending a message of condolence to Prof Hawking's family.

Prof Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said in a statement: "His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world.

"He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love'. We will miss him forever."
